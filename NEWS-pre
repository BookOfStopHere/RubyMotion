= RubyMotion 3.1 =

  * Added the RUBYMOTION_VERSION and RUBYMOTION_ENV constants, which have the
    same values as RubyMotion for iOS / OS X.
  * Added support for the Android R class. Thanks to Mark Villacampa for the
    patch.
  * Fixed a bug where `app.vendor_project' would generate a .bridgesupport
    file containing illegal XML characters (such as '<' or '>') inside
    attributes. Thanks to Mark Villacampa for the patch.
  * Fixed a bug where the dispatch of an overloaded Java method without
    arguments would fail. The runtime will now return the first method of the
    list (since we can't match any argument).

= RubyMotion 3.0 =

  * First public beta with Android support. Make sure to read the "Getting
    Started" guide on the Developer Center in order to properly set up the
    environment. You also recommend that you read the "Runtime" and "Project
    Management" guides.
