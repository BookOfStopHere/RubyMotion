= RubyMotion 3.1 =

  * Added the RUBYMOTION_VERSION and RUBYMOTION_ENV constants, which have the
    same values as RubyMotion for iOS / OS X.
  * Added support for the Android R class. Thanks to Mark Villacampa for the
    patch.
  * Added the `app.application_class' setting, which can be used to specify
    the name of a custom Android::App::Application subclass that should be used
    by the application. By default, the variable has a nil value, which means
    a default class will be used.
  * Improved app versioning. `app.api_version' will now map to the
    `minSdkVersion' manifest attribute. Added `app.target_api_version' which
    will map to `targetSdkVersion'. Both settings will have the latest API
    version as the default value, except for 20 (L). We recommend that you
    leave `app.target_api_version' intact and only modify `app.api_version'.
  * Improved the REPL so that "self" now always points to the current app
    activity. (Only works for API 14 or above.)
  * Fixed a bug where `app.vendor_project' would generate a .bridgesupport
    file containing illegal XML characters (such as '<' or '>') inside
    attributes. Thanks to Mark Villacampa for the patch.
  * Fixed a bug where the dispatch of an overloaded Java method without
    arguments would fail. The runtime will now return the first method of the
    list (since we can't match any argument).
  * Fixed the `rake {emulator,device}' tasks to terminate the application in
    case the user leaves the REPL session.
  * Fixed a bug when dispatching certain methods using reflection (REPL) that
    return java.lang.Object.

= RubyMotion 3.0 =

  * First public beta with Android support. Make sure to read the "Getting
    Started" guide on the Developer Center in order to properly set up the
    environment. You also recommend that you read the "Runtime" and "Project
    Management" guides.
