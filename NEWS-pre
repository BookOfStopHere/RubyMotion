= RubyMotion 3.0 beta 0.5 =

  * Fixed the build system to fail with a proper error message when trying
    to install an app on a device that runs an API version lower than the one
    targetted by the app itself. Patch by Mark Villacampa.
  * Fixed a bug where constant lookups inside modules would cause a crash.
  * Fixed a bug where methods in a module included in a module included in a
    class would not be copied to that class (yeah, I know).

= RubyMotion 3.0 beta 0.4 =

  * Added support for Android API 3, 4, 7, 10 and 11. All versions of Android
    installable by the Android SDK manager are now supported.
  * Fixed the runtime to not create global weak references when running on
    Android API 8 or below. These are not supported and trying to use them
    results in a crash. A better workaround will be applied later on.
  * Fixed the detection of the `zipalign' tool (again). Thanks to Norberto
    Ortigoza for the help.
  * Fixed the build system to fail with a proper error message in case the
    installed NDK does not support the API level we want.
  * Fixed the build system to properly use the right NDK headers when
    targetting a API level that is not covered, as it skips API levels with no
    public changes. Thanks to Mark Villacampa for the help.
  * Fixed the `jarsigner' invocation to support JDK 1.7. Thanks to Mark
    Villacampa for the patch.
  * Fixed a bug where the RubyMotion JNI library wouldn't properly load on
    older versions of Android (such as API 8). Thanks to Mark Villacampa for
    the patch.
  * Fixed the build system to generate an AndroidManifest.xml file without
    `configChanges' attributes. Google doesn't recommend setting it and it's
    also not supported in older versions of Android (such as API 8).  Thanks
    to Mark Villacampa for the patch.
  * Fixed the detection of the Android build tools directory on certain
    installations of the SDK. Thanks to Mark Villacampa for the patch.  

= RubyMotion 3.0 beta 0.3 =

  * Added support for Android API 8.

= RubyMotion 3.0 beta 0.2 =

  * Fixed the detection of the `zipalign' tool.
  * Fixed a crash when sending #new to a Class object where an object of the
    superclass would be returned instead of the actual class.

= RubyMotion 3.0 beta 0.1 =

  * First release.
