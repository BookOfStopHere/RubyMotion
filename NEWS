= RubyMotion 0.32 =

  * Fixed a bug where canceling the `rake simulator' task with ^C would not
    properly terminate the simulator session.
  * Added basic spec framework integration. See doc/ReferenceManual.html for
    more information.

= RubyMotion 0.31 =

  * Fixed the build system to avoid copying resource files each time.
  * Fixed a bug where some class method calling stubs would not be properly
    precompiled, such as NSTimer
    +scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval:target:selector:userInfo:repeats:.
  * Added a `prerendered_icon' config setting, which, when set to true,
    disables the reflective shine effect applied by default on the icons
    files (thanks Watson).
  * Changed the `simulator' task to honor the `device_family' environment
    variable, which can be used to force the device family to be used by the
    simulator when running a universal app. Values can be 'iphone' or 'ipad'.
    (Thanks Matt Aimonetti for the idea.)
  * Fixed the `simulator' task to no longer remove the app sandbox directory
    by default. Instead, the `clean' environment variable must be provided.
    (For example, `$ rake simulator clean=1').

= RubyMotion 0.30 =

  * Fixed a bug where deploying large applications would fail during install.
  * Fixed a bug where boolean values (true/false) would not be allowed in the
    `plist' Hash (thanks Matt Aimonetti).
  * Merged `tableview' and `mapview' samples into a new sample: `beers', which
    also demonstrates the use of a tab bar controller and webview.
  * Fixed a bug in the build system where old resource files, that have since
    been deleted from the project, would still be present in the app bundle.
  * Fixed the `simulator' task to empty the app sandbox directory before
    running the simulator, to make sure old resource files will not be present.

= RubyMotion 0.29 =

  * Improved some error messages.
  * Added support for CFTypes. Before, nil values would be returned instead.
  * Added support for C-level blocks and function pointers arguments.
  * Fixed a bug when trying to retrieve compiled stubs for method types that
    include type modifiers (like `const'). Example: NSValue's valueWithPointer:.
  * Fixed a bug when the build system would fail when attempting to copy
    resource files, if resources_dir does not exist.

= RubyMotion 0.28 =

  * Fixed a bug when using APIs dealing with pointers to anonymous C structs.
    Example: AVFoundation's copyCGImageAtTime:actualTime:error:.
  * Fixed a bug in the build system when copying resource files into the app
    bundle, where directories inside resources_dir would not be copied.
  * Fixed the plist generator to generate properly-indented plists.
  * Updated doc/ReferenceManual.html to track the changes above.
  * Added the `libs' config setting, the list of libraries to link against.
    Empty by default, can be used in case a project requires a specific C
    library, for example libz.dylib.
  * Added the `scheme' and `products' keys of `vendor_project'.
  * Fixed a bug where the `xcodeproj' key of `vendor_project' would not be taken
    into account.

= RubyMotion 0.27 =

  * Added support for most iOS frameworks.

= RubyMotion 0.26 =

  * Updated doc/ReferenceManual.html to track the new changes.
  * Added the `entitlements' config setting, which exposes the
    Entitlements.plist file as a Hash object that can be changed.
  * Added the `seed_id' config setting, the provisioning app identifier.
  * Improved the build system so that if the build_dir cannot be created, a
    temporary build directory will be used instead. This can happen when trying
    to build a project on a read-only directory.
  * Fixed a bug where resource files would not be copied if the default rake
    runs with Ruby 1.9.
  * Added a new key to `vendor_project' with :xcode: `headers_dir'. Should be
    set to the path that contains headers files.

= RubyMotion 0.25 =

  * Fixed regressions in the build system.

= RubyMotion 0.24 =

  * Updated doc/ReferenceManual.html to track the new changes and also to
    mention the `files_dependencies' config setting.
  * Added the `info_plist' config setting, which exposes the Info.plist file as
    a Hash object that can be changed (for advanced settings).
  * Added the `identifier' config setting, reverse DNS name for an app.
  * Reorganized the rake interface. Existing projects should migrate from
    `motion/rake' to `motion/project', and from `Motion::App' to
    `Motion::Project::App'.
  * Refined support for vendor libraries.

= RubyMotion 0.23 =

  * Added basic support for vendor libraries. See doc/ReferenceManual.html for
    how it works.

= RubyMotion 0.22 =

  * Added the `no_continue' environment variable for `rake sim debug=1'.
  * Fixed a bug when retrieving some C constants (wrong pointer dereferencing).
  * Fixed a couple bugs when compiling setter methods (/^set[A-Z]/).
  * Added support for QuickLook.framework.

= RubyMotion 0.21 =

  * Renamed the `package' rake task to `archive'.
  * Fixed the build system to use a different build directory per SDK version.
  * Added support for QuartzCore.framework.
  * Fixed a crash when attempting to freeze certain objects (associative
    reference assertion).
  * Better tweets sample code (thanks Johannes Fahrenkrug).
  * Added support for attr_*.
  * Fixed a crash when converting int64 CFNumbers into Ruby types.

= RubyMotion 0.20 =

  * Fixed misc GC bugs.
  * Added tweets sample code.
  * Added reference manual (doc/ReferenceManual.html).

= RubyMotion 0.19 =

  * Added support for app icons. Icon files can be created and copied into the
    resources directory, then their filenames can be added to app.icons.
  * Validate given sdk_version config variable.
