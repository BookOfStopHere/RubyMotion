= RubyMotion 1.3 =

  * Fixed a bug in format strings with width / precision modifiers.
  * Disabled the automatic loading of motion- gems.
  * Added support for the compilation of Interface Builder resource files.
    .xib files present in the `resources' directory will be compiled to .nib
    files then copied in the app bundle. .nib files are added to the default
    .gitignore and removed during `rake clean'. Thanks Ian Phillips.
  * Improved the `rake device' error message to mention that Wi-Fi sync might
    cause device deployments to fail.
  * Fixed a bug in NSArray#reject where the new array would not be returned.

= RubyMotion 1.2 =

  * Fixed a couple bugs in the project vendoring code that would be triggered
    when using the motion-cocoapods gem. The fixes were merged from the
    https://github.com/HipByte/motion-cocoapods/issues/1 discussion.
  * Fixed codesign bugs in `rake archive:release'.
  * Improved the Xcode detection code by printing a warning message in case
    the user installed a recent Xcode in /Applications that has not been
    set as the default Xcode in the system yet.
  * Fixed a typo in the REPL help message (thanks Mike Clark).

= RubyMotion 1.1 =

  * Fixed `rake device' to print a human-readable error message in case the
    deployment might fail because another process is connected to the device.
  * Fixed a bug in `rake simulator' where view detection would not work on
    non-English desktops (error "Cannot locate the Simulator app").
    Make sure to exit the Simulator app after applying this update.

= RubyMotion 1.0 =

  * First release.
