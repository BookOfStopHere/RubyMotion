= RubyMotion 1.14 =

  * Fixed a bug in the Struct class where certain instances would be released
    twice and triggering a malloc error.
  * Fixed a bug where aliasing a method generated by attr_* would trigger an
    assertion at runtime when being called.
  * Fixed a bug where calling methods generated by attr_* from Objective-C
    would return NSNull instead of nil in case the attribute is nil.
  * Fixed a bug in the random number generator where the generator would not be
    properly initialized in certain cases (ex. Array#sample), therefore always
    returning the same values.
  * Fixed a bug where using C structures containing bitfields (ex. NSDecimal)
    would trigger an exception at compilation time. 
  * Added support for pointers to C strings (needed for glShaderSource()).
    Usage: Pointer.new(:string, n) where n is the number of C strings, then
    simply assign Ruby strings with #[]=.
  * Changed the runtime to log all raised exceptions via NSLog(). This behavior
    can be controlled via the Exception.log_exceptions variable (which is true
    by default, but can be set to false).
  * Introduced new project variables: short_version, background_modes and
    status_bar_style. Patch by Francis Chong.

= RubyMotion 1.13 =

  * Fixed a regression in `rake simulator' introduced by the last update.
    Also, the environment variable used to set the SDK target is renamed to
    `target' (ex. rake target=4.3).
  * Fixed a bug in the build system where certain .rb files would be rebuilt
    every time `rake build' was executed, because the object directory was not
    touched.
  * Fixed a bug in the build system where the RUBYOPT variable would not be
    cleared when calling the gen_bridge_metadata tool, which would cause some
    issues later on. Patch by Satoshi Ebisawa.

= RubyMotion 1.12 =

  * Fixed a bug where sending an `init' message alone (without using `alloc'
    before) would lead to a memory crash. This was possible when overloading
    an initWith* method and doing `self.init' inside.
  * Fixed a bug where performing Objective-C methods that accept CFType objects
    would crash the program (ex. [ABPersonViewController setDisplayedPerson:]).
  * Switched to clang++ to link the executable bits. This fixes linker crashes
    on iOS 6.0.
  * Added `fast' output for `rake spec'. Fixed a bug in the other outputs.
    Patch by Marin Usalj.
  * Improved the build system to let the user specify CPU archs that should be
    used for a certain platform. The `app.archs' method returns a Hash that one
    can tweak. This is so far only useful when you target 4.3 (which is armv6
    and armv7) and want to link with a 3rd-party library that only supports
    armv7 (ex. app.archs['iPhoneOS'] = ['armv7']).
  * Improved `rake simulator' to honor the `deployment_target' environment
    variable (ex. rake deployment_target=4.3). Patch by Satoshi Ebisawa.
  * Fixed a bug in the build system where the compiler would not use the right
    BridgeSupport files when using a lower deployment_target.
    Patch by Satoshi Ebisawa.
  * Fixed the build system to re-link the .app executable in case one of the
    vendored libraries changed.
  * Fixed bugs in both ARM/simulator compilers where structures smaller than
    64 bits would not be following the ABI and causing unexpected behavior in
    certain cases (ex. cocos2d). Thanks to Aaron Hurley for the detective work.
  * Removed Kernel#select as it clashes with a private `select' method defined
    by iOS and triggered when hitting the select button in a paste action.
    Thanks to Francis Chong for the detective work.

= RubyMotion 1.11 =

  * Fixed a bug where the runtime would not allow `nil' to be passed as a
    C-level block argument.
  * Fixed a bug where methods defined by attr_* would abort the program when
    called by Objective-C.
  * Improved `rake spec' to honor the `output' environment variable, which can
    be used to select a different output format. Available formats: spec_dox,
    test_unit, tap and knock (ex. rake spec output=test_unit).
  * Support for the iOS 6.0 Beta 1 SDK can be generated after having installed
    Xcode 4.5 by typing the following command:
    $ cd /Library/RubyMotion/data/6.0; rake update

= RubyMotion 1.10 =

  * Fixed the build system to validate the content of the `app.icons' variable,
    since a wrong value may trigger an "unrecognized selector" exception in
    Application Loader when trying to submit the app to the App Store.
  * Fixed the Rakefile created by `motion create' to include the magic utf8
    comment, as the file may contain multibyte characters and be parsed by
    Ruby 1.9. Patch by @pchw.
  * Fixed a memory bug when using symbols as Hash keys.
  * Exposed iOS 4.3 (or greater) libdispatch APIs.
  * The following NSString methods that used to raise a "does not work on
    NSStrings" exception are no longer defined: byte_size, get_byte, set_byte,
    force_encoding, valid_encoding?, ascii_only?, bytes, each_byte, to_data,
    pointer. This allows the developer to use respond_to?. These methods
    however are available on strings created in Ruby.
  * Fixed a bug in `rake simulator' where the value of `deployment_target'
    would be used as the SDK version, causing a `system_root != nil' assertion
    in some cases.
  * Fixed the compilation of empty symbols (:'').
  * Fixed the generation of .bridgesupport files on Snow Leopard by not
    passing the '--no-64-bit' flag (which was added in Lion).
  * Fixed `motion create' to accept dash or underscore characters in the app
    name. Patch by Mark Villacampa.
  * Added a workaround for an iOS 5.1 bug that causes write(2) to return EBADF 
    when writing to stdout. The bug seems to happen on devices not configured
    for development. Writing to stdout (using p/puts) in this scenario becomes
    a no-op.
  * Fixed the simulator launcher to properly propagate exit(2) status codes
    from the simulated app. This fixes `rake spec' to properly exit with 1 in
    case one or more specs failed to run.
  * Fixed the RUBY_ENGINE constant to be 'rubymotion' (was 'macruby' before).
  * Objective-C objects conforming to the NSFastEnumeration protocol can now be
    iterated using the #each method. The method is created on demand on these
    objects.
  * Fixed a bug in the simulator REPL where hitting the Home button would
    trigger an insane CPU usage.

= RubyMotion 1.9 =

  * Fixed a bug in the build system where the paths of vendored libraries
    would not be properly quoted and cause a build failure in case they
    contain space characters.
  * Fixed a bug in the build system where using a lower deployment_target
    version would cause a link error at runtime because the application was
    linking against a framework that does not exist (ex. CoreImage on 4.3).
  * Fixed the `rake spec' task to not move the simulator window to the
    foreground.
  * Fixed a bug in the compiler where APIs accepting pointers to
    CoreFoundation types could not be given Pointer objects of the :object
    type (ex. CFErrorRef*).
  * Added support for CoreAudio (experimental). At the very least, constants
    pointing to four-bytes characters should be properly covered.
  * Fixed a typo in "expected array of %d elements, got %d" exception message
    where the numbers were inverted. Thanks Enrico Thierbach.
  * Fixed a bug in the compiler where compiling strings containing only null
    characters (ex. "\x00") would cause a crash.

= RubyMotion 1.8 =

  * Fixed a bug in the generation of BridgeSupport files for multiple headers
    directories.
  * When building vendored projects, unset environment variables that could
    potentially make the build to fail.
    https://github.com/HipByte/motion-cocoapods/issues/12

= RubyMotion 1.7 =

  * Fixed a bug in the compiler where the proper signature would not be used
    when defining informal protocol methods with CF types as arguments.
  * Fixed iOS constants to be looked up at demand (when being used) and not
    when the app starts, because certain constants are not set until a certain
    API is called (ex: the kAB... constants of the AddressBook framework).
    This change should also speed up a little bit the app starting time.
  * Fixed a bug in the compiler where very long selectors would be truncated
    and causing exceptions later at runtime.
  * Fixed a bug in the compiler where memory-related selectors (alloc, dealloc,
    retain, release, etc.) could not be defined in Ruby.
  * Fixed a bug in the compiler where NSObject instance methods could not be
    called on classes (ex. MyClass.performSelector(...)).
  * Fixed a bug in the build system where vendored 3rd-party APIs dealing with
    types defined in iOS headers could not be used (ex: enums or structs).

= RubyMotion 1.6 =

  * Fixed a regression in the build system introduced by the previous update
    (when compiling .xib files).
  * Fixed the vendoring system to include all source code files. Merged patch
    from https://groups.google.com/d/msg/rubymotion/tPCxSMCA2f4/w2DIHFo2AVAJ
  * Fixed the REPL to not crash if you give it an empty expression.

= RubyMotion 1.5 =

  * Improved the REPL to support multi-line expressions.
  * Fixed a bug when compiling Core Data model files where the `momc' utility
    was not given absolute paths.
  * Removed legacy MacRuby code that was using the private `isaForAutonotifying'
    selector and causing a warning during an App Store submission.
  * Fixed a bug in Enumerable#sort_by that would lead to a crash.
  * Fixed a bug in the REPL where it would not detect the iOS Simulator window
    if certain windows were in front or created later.
  * Fixed a bug in the build system where framework dependencies would not be
    properly handled.
  * Added support for .lproj directories (i18n). Thanks Aaron Hurley.
  * Fixed a bug where objects from pure Ruby classes sent to KVO would not be
    properly handled later (because KVO inserts a new singleton class).
  * Fixed attr_writer to emit KVO notifications (will/didChangeValueForKey).

= RubyMotion 1.4 =

  * Added support for the compilation of .xcdatamodeld and .storyboard resource
    files. Thanks Ian Phillips, Andrew Vega and Michail Pishchagin.
  * Fixed a bug when the build system would fail in case the resources dir does
    not exist. Thanks Watson.
  * Fixed a bug in the Xcode project vendoring code when header files at
    different directory levels would not be properly handled. This also fixes
    the motion-cocoapods gem. Thanks Eloy Duran.
  * Added a way to start the simulator in retina mode by setting the `retina'
    environment variable to `true' (other values will be considered false).
    For example: `rake retina=true'. Thanks Marcin Maciukiewicz for the idea.
  * Fixed an ABI bug in the way we compile Ruby methods overloading Objective-C
    methods returning small C structures that can fit in a 64-bit integer.
    Thanks Kristoph Cichocki-Romanov for the report.
  * Added support for the iOS 4.3 SDK.

= RubyMotion 1.3 =

  * Fixed a bug in format strings with width / precision modifiers.
  * Disabled the automatic loading of motion- gems.
  * Added support for the compilation of Interface Builder resource files.
    .xib files present in the `resources' directory will be compiled to .nib
    files then copied in the app bundle. .nib files are added to the default
    .gitignore and removed during `rake clean'. Thanks Ian Phillips.
  * Improved the `rake device' error message to mention that Wi-Fi sync might
    cause device deployments to fail.
  * Fixed a bug in NSArray#reject where the new array would not be returned.

= RubyMotion 1.2 =

  * Fixed a couple bugs in the project vendoring code that would be triggered
    when using the motion-cocoapods gem. The fixes were merged from the
    https://github.com/HipByte/motion-cocoapods/issues/1 discussion.
  * Fixed codesign bugs in `rake archive:release'.
  * Improved the Xcode detection code by printing a warning message in case
    the user installed a recent Xcode in /Applications that has not been
    set as the default Xcode in the system yet.
  * Fixed a typo in the REPL help message (thanks Mike Clark).

= RubyMotion 1.1 =

  * Fixed `rake device' to print a human-readable error message in case the
    deployment might fail because another process is connected to the device.
  * Fixed a bug in `rake simulator' where view detection would not work on
    non-English desktops (error "Cannot locate the Simulator app").
    Make sure to exit the Simulator app after applying this update.

= RubyMotion 1.0 =

  * First release.
