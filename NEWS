= RubyMotion 1.9 =

  * Fixed a bug in the build system where the paths of vendored libraries
    would not be properly quoted and cause a build failure in case they
    contain space characters.
  * Fixed a bug in the build system where using a lower deployment_target
    version would cause a link error at runtime because the application was
    linking against a framework that does not exist (ex. CoreImage on 4.3).
  * Fixed the `rake spec' task to not move the simulator window to the
    foreground.
  * Fixed a bug in the compiler where APIs accepting pointers to
    CoreFoundation types could not be given Pointer objects of the :object
    type (ex. CFErrorRef*).
  * Added support for CoreAudio (experimental). At the very least, constants
    pointing to four-bytes characters should be properly covered.
  * Fixed a typo in "expected array of %d elements, got %d" exception message
    where the numbers were inverted. Thanks Enrico Thierbach.
  * Fixed a bug in the compiler where compiling strings containing only null
    characters (ex. "\x00") would cause a crash.

= RubyMotion 1.8 =

  * Fixed a bug in the generation of BridgeSupport files for multiple headers
    directories.
  * When building vendored projects, unset environment variables that could
    potentially make the build to fail.

= RubyMotion 1.7 =

  * Fixed a bug in the compiler where the proper signature would not be used
    when defining informal protocol methods with CF types as arguments.
  * Fixed iOS constants to be looked up at demand (when being used) and not
    when the app starts, because certain constants are not set until a certain
    API is called (ex: the kAB... constants of the AddressBook framework).
    This change should also speed up a little bit the app starting time.
  * Fixed a bug in the compiler where very long selectors would be truncated
    and causing exceptions later at runtime.
  * Fixed a bug in the compiler where memory-related selectors (alloc, dealloc,
    retain, release, etc.) could not be defined in Ruby.
  * Fixed a bug in the compiler where NSObject instance methods could not be
    called on classes (ex. MyClass.performSelector(...)).
  * Fixed a bug in the build system where vendored 3rd-party APIs dealing with
    types defined in iOS headers could not be used (ex: enums or structs).

= RubyMotion 1.6 =

  * Fixed a regression in the build system introduced by the previous update
    (when compiling .xib files).
  * Fixed the vendoring system to include all source code files. Merged patch
    from https://groups.google.com/d/msg/rubymotion/tPCxSMCA2f4/w2DIHFo2AVAJ
  * Fixed the REPL to not crash if you give it an empty expression.

= RubyMotion 1.5 =

  * Improved the REPL to support multi-line expressions.
  * Fixed a bug when compiling Core Data model files where the `momc' utility
    was not given absolute paths.
  * Removed legacy MacRuby code that was using the private `isaForAutonotifying'
    selector and causing a warning during an App Store submission.
  * Fixed a bug in Enumerable#sort_by that would lead to a crash.
  * Fixed a bug in the REPL where it would not detect the iOS Simulator window
    if certain windows were in front or created later.
  * Fixed a bug in the build system where framework dependencies would not be
    properly handled.
  * Added support for .lproj directories (i18n). Thanks Aaron Hurley.
  * Fixed a bug where objects from pure Ruby classes sent to KVO would not be
    properly handled later (because KVO inserts a new singleton class).
  * Fixed attr_writer to emit KVO notifications (will/didChangeValueForKey).

= RubyMotion 1.4 =

  * Added support for the compilation of .xcdatamodeld and .storyboard resource
    files. Thanks Ian Phillips, Andrew Vega and Michail Pishchagin.
  * Fixed a bug when the build system would fail in case the resources dir does
    not exist. Thanks Watson.
  * Fixed a bug in the Xcode project vendoring code when header files at
    different directory levels would not be properly handled. This also fixes
    the motion-cocoapods gem. Thanks Eloy Duran.
  * Added a way to start the simulator in retina mode by setting the `retina'
    environment variable to `true' (other values will be considered false).
    For example: `rake retina=true'. Thanks Marcin Maciukiewicz for the idea.
  * Fixed an ABI bug in the way we compile Ruby methods overloading Objective-C
    methods returning small C structures that can fit in a 64-bit integer.
    Thanks Kristoph Cichocki-Romanov for the report.
  * Added support for the iOS 4.3 SDK.

= RubyMotion 1.3 =

  * Fixed a bug in format strings with width / precision modifiers.
  * Disabled the automatic loading of motion- gems.
  * Added support for the compilation of Interface Builder resource files.
    .xib files present in the `resources' directory will be compiled to .nib
    files then copied in the app bundle. .nib files are added to the default
    .gitignore and removed during `rake clean'. Thanks Ian Phillips.
  * Improved the `rake device' error message to mention that Wi-Fi sync might
    cause device deployments to fail.
  * Fixed a bug in NSArray#reject where the new array would not be returned.

= RubyMotion 1.2 =

  * Fixed a couple bugs in the project vendoring code that would be triggered
    when using the motion-cocoapods gem. The fixes were merged from the
    https://github.com/HipByte/motion-cocoapods/issues/1 discussion.
  * Fixed codesign bugs in `rake archive:release'.
  * Improved the Xcode detection code by printing a warning message in case
    the user installed a recent Xcode in /Applications that has not been
    set as the default Xcode in the system yet.
  * Fixed a typo in the REPL help message (thanks Mike Clark).

= RubyMotion 1.1 =

  * Fixed `rake device' to print a human-readable error message in case the
    deployment might fail because another process is connected to the device.
  * Fixed a bug in `rake simulator' where view detection would not work on
    non-English desktops (error "Cannot locate the Simulator app").
    Make sure to exit the Simulator app after applying this update.

= RubyMotion 1.0 =

  * First release.
