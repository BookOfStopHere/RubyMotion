h1. Getting Started

Welcome to RubyMotion. This guide will help getting you started.

h2. Overview

RubyMotion is a toolchain that permits the development of iOS applications using the Ruby programming language.

"iOS":http://www.apple.com/ios/ is Apple's mobile operating system, powering a variety of devices such as iPhone, iPod touch and iPad. Developers can write applications for iOS and submit them to the App Store, Apple's application distribution system.

Conceptually, RubyMotion is a combination of three components:

* *Runtime*: a new implementation of the Ruby language for iOS, tightly integrated with the native iOS runtime and customized for embedded devices constrains.
* *Tool*: a command-line interface to create and manage RubyMotion projects.
* *Library*: a high-level Ruby library sitting on top of the iOS SDK that facilitates the development of applications.

RubyMotion installs itself into +/Library/Motion+. A symbolic link to the command-line interface is created as +/usr/bin/motion+.

h2. License Activation

You should have received an email after purchasing RubyMotion, which contains a license key of 40 hexadecimal characters. This key can be used to activate RubyMotion.

<pre>
$ sudo motion activate <license-key...>
</pre>

h2. Software Updates

Software updates can be applied via the command-line.

<pre>
$ sudo motion update
</pre>

This command will grab the latest version of RubyMotion from the network and install it. You must be connected to the Internet to perform that command.

You can always see the version number of the version of RubyMotion installed on the computer.

<pre>
$ motion -v
1.0
</pre>

h2. More Information

You will find sample code in the "/Library/Motion/sample":file:///Library/Motion/sample directory.
Each of these samples can be run by typing the +rake+ command in their directory. 

To learn more about RubyMotion, check out the "/Library/Motion/doc":file:///Library/Motion/doc directory, which contains guides about the RubyMotion runtime, project management tool, and library.

More documentation, such as tutorials or screencasts, is also available online from the "Developer Center":http://www.rubymotion.com/devcenter.
